/**
 * TODO Goal of this class is to solve some mathematics operations. Create methods as follows:
 *
 * 1. method 'sum' receives 2 parameters of type 'int' and returns their sum
 * 2. method 'difference' receives 2 parameters of type 'int' (ex. param1, param2) and returns the result of 'param1 - param2'
 * 3. method 'divide' receives 2 parameters of type 'int' (ex. param1, param2) and return the result of 'param1 / param2'
 *    - also the method checks if 'param2' is 0 and in this case throws an exception
 * 4. method 'factor' receives 2 parameters of type 'int' (ex. param1, param2) and returns their products
 *
 *  For each method write unit tests to assuring it works as expected.
